# but will also make it slower and increase CPU usage

[input]

# Audio capturing method. Possible methods are: 'pulse', 'alsa', 'fifo', 'sndio' or 'shmem'
# Defaults to 'pulse', 'alsa' or 'fifo', in that order, dependent on what support cava was built with.
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source'
# to define where it should get the audio.
#
# For pulseaudio 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the monitor source of the default sink
# (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them).
#
# For alsa 'source' will be the capture device.
# For fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file.
# For shmem 'source' will be /squeezelite-AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF where 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF' will be squeezelite's MAC address

[output]

# Output method. Can be 'ncurses', 'noncurses' or 'raw'.
# 'noncurses' uses a custom framebuffer technique and draws only changes
# from frame to frame. As of version 0.7.0 'noncurses' is default.
#
# 'raw' is an 8 or 16 bit (configurable via the 'bit_format' option) data
# stream of the bar heights that can be used to send to other applications.
# 'raw' defaults to 200 bars, which can be adjusted in the 'bars' option above.
method = ncurses

# Visual channels. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# 'stereo' mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# 'mono' outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies.
# 'mono_option' set mono to either take input from 'left', 'right' or 'average'.

# Ascii max value. In 'ascii' mode range will run from 0 to value specified here
; ascii_max_range = 1000

# Use decimal value in ascii table (i.e. 59 = ';' and 10 = '\n' (line feed)).

[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.

[smoothing]

# Disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing" with or without "waves". Set to 0 to disable.
; monstercat = 0

# In bar height, bars that would have been lower that this will not be drawn.

[eq]

# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want.
# Remember to uncomment more then one key! More keys = more precision.
# Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
